The website allows the users to lookup products descriptions, types, manufacturers… etc. Users
should be allowed to create an account, add items to their “cart” and search for products. The website should
initially be hosted on your PCs “local host” and when the site development phase is done, you should host
it online on the cloud platform heroku.com
